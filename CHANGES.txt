Changes
*******

1.0 (2010-05-20)
================

- Amend the interactive_debug_prompt function to behave more or less like the
  "old" zopectl command. Whenever there's commandline arguments passed to the
  command, the first one is assumed to be a python script that is 'execfile'd.
  This allows ad hoc scripts to run against the setup application.

- Make package comply to zope.org repository policy.

- The upgrade notes will be moved to the Grok upgrade notes.

- Define entry points for main and debug application factories in
  grokcore.startup.

- Use the groktoolkit.

0.4 (2009-10-06)
================

- Fix documentation bugs.

0.3 (2009-10-02)
================

* Add a ``debug_application_factory`` function that allows for the
  ``exempt-exceptions`` configuration option. The value for this option
  should be a comma seperated list of dotted names for each of the exceptions
  that should not be re-raised during debugging.

  This for one allow the IUnauthorized exception to still be handled by zope
  and thus have the normal authentication mechanisms still work.

* Bring versions.cfg in line with current grok versions.cfg.

0.2 (2009-02-21)
================

* Made main functions available package wide.

0.1 (2009-01-15)
================

* Added support for local ``zope_conf`` parameter.
  Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/320644

* Created ``grokcore.startup`` in January 2009 by factoring paster
  related application code out of grokcore templates.
