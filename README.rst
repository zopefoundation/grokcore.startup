Setting up ``grokcore.startup``
===============================

There is nothing special to setup this package.

All you have to do is, to make this package available during runtime.

With `zc.buildout`_ or other `setuptools`_-related setups this can be
done by simply adding the package name ``grokcore.startup`` to the
required packages of your project in ``setup.py``.
